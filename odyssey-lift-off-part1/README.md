# Odyssey Lift-off I: Basics

Welcome to the companion app of Odyssey Lift-off I! You can [find the course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://odyssey-catstronauts.netlify.app/).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 3 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.
- `final`: The final stage of both the server and client folders, with all of the steps and code completed!

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

Dev Note: 
I wanted to try out Prettier since it seems graphql team uses it sometimes. 
To format using prettier: 
1. run `npm run format`
To check the status of current formatting using prettier:
2. run `npm run format:check`

Also just a reminder since we use yarn at SME:
Run the server:
`npm run dev`

In another terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
